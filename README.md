# nabaz: a change based test runner
Hate waiting for tests?    
Reduce **80-95%** of test run time by skipping tests unaffected by code.
 

![nabaz installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nabaz-io/nabaz/main/docs/goinstall.gif)

Run it **locally** like so:

```bash
CMDLINE="pytest -v"
nabaz test --cmdline $CMDLINE ./
```
_**Note:** [Contact us](#contact-us) for early access to **CI/CD** version (remote storage, integration, system tests support)._
